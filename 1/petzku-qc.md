# Train

## 02

> 00:03:12: And, also, my name is Tulip; \NI... should’ve said that earlier.

IMO remove first comma (barely any pause)
semicolon seems too long for the pause after "Tulip"

> 00:05:22: Deal.

slightly questionable timing on end IMO. feels too long to snap, but also too short to leave just like that. maybe slightly reduce lead-out?

> 00:06:21: Oh, I know! I know!

"ooh", if you want to make the distinction

> 00:07:37: this is goodbye.

consider some punctuation... or maybe not idk

> 00:09:18: ...wanted to get off the train.

ok this one definitely wants `...` before "the train" I think

> 00:10:11: {\3c&H505F41&\c&H505F41&\blur1}One-One!
> 00:10:11: {\bord0\shad0\c&HC9D2B3&\blur1}One-One!

perfection

> 00:10:32: 

missing(?) one-one "oh no"

> 00:10:46: I was just scared I would \Nnever get off the train,

stutter?

## 03

> 00:00:21: Ugh! That cat wasted time \NI could’ve used getting off the train.

capitalise "Cat"?

> 00:00:48: Look at me!\NI’m a musical genius!

memes: ktime/kfx this (probably by words)

> 00:04:03: It is the monster.

consider capitalising?

> 00:04:56: Didn’t you want to \Ngo outside?

why the linebreak?

> "un-solveable"

I don't agree with the hyphen

## 04

> 00:01:25: I just have to go about it\Nusing the Scientific Method.

disagree @ capsing

## 05

> 00:01:19: Is this the cat\Nyou told me about?

also capitalisation question

> 00:02:49: This tape contains everything\Nthat makes you you.

italicise second "you"?

## 06

> 00:01:55: Emperor and Unifier \Nof the Hard- and Soft-Shelled.

not 100% sure about this "hard- and soft-shelled" grammar (I *think* it's correct but not *quite* sure)

> 00:04:24: We know where the door is, \Nso I guess it wouldn’t hurt to stay for a little while.

italicise "little"?

> 00:04:34: {\an8}that no citizen can be denied a stroll...
> Meet back here\Nin one hour!

idk about \an8'ing this when the previous half of the sentence is \an2

> 00:05:16: just don’t tell\Nthe missus.

again imo no need to split

> 00:07:55: and our kingdom\Nwill be torn apart!

\>torn

## 07

> 00:01:03: 

memesub time (atticus barking at his reflection)? probably nah

> "Prime"

would using the Prime symbol (′) be too meme?

## 08

... nothing? that can't be right

## 09

> 00:03:17: Je suis désolé.

feminine: désolée

> 00:03:22: That didn’t work at all!

maybe emphasise "at all"

> 00:05:45: I do hope that it’s acceptable.

maybe "accept-able"? there's a slight break there which feels very unnatural imo

## 10

... nothing again?
